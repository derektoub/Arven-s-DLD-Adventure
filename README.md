Arven's DLD Adventure
=====================

A homage to the bizarre and exciting life of Arven. This game brings us between lovers and worlds, with even more breakdancing and unspeakable horror than described in the giant walls of text that are the legends of Arven.

The game is still in development, but if you want to play it, clone this repository, (git clone https://github.com/derektoub/Arven-s-DLD-Adventure.git), then run ./YES.sh (for *nix systems). YES.exe may run for Windows (haven't tested it, don't have Windows).

To work on the game yourself, clone the repository (as described above), then edit the file called "script.rpy" in YES-1.0-all/game. After editing, you will need to rebuild the project, which can be done using the Ren'Py GUI. To get to the GUI, download Ren'Py (see the link below), navigate inside the renpy-[insert version number here]-sdk folder and do ./renpy.sh (or renpy.exe for Windows). For the Arven project to show up in the GUI, you must move the YES-1.0-all folder inside of the renpy folder.

Made using [Ren'Py](http://www.renpy.org/), a fantastic visual novel engine for Python.
