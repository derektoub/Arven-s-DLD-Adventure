Arven's DLD Adventure
=====================

A homage to the bizarre and exciting life of Arven. This game brings us between lovers and worlds, with even more breakdancing and unspeakable horror than described in the giant walls of text that are the legends of Arven.

The game is still in development, but if you want to play it, run ./YES.sh (Linux), and YES.exe may run for Windows (haven't tested it, don't have Windows). Mac distribution will be included when the project is complete (or earlier, if people actually want it)

To work on the game yourself, put this in your terminal:
    git clone https://github.com/derektoub/Arven-s-DLD-Adventure.git

Then, edit the file called "script.rpy" in YES-1.0-all/game.

Made using [Ren'Py](http://www.renpy.org/), a fantastic visual novel engine for Python.
