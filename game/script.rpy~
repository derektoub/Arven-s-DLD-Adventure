        wiz "Cities fall, and oceans rise. That one coffee shop you like shuts down, and is replaced with a Starbucks. That Starbucks is then razed during riots, which are only quelled when an Earthquake swallows New York City, and spits it back out into the atmosphere. The remains of the city land on Beijing, a phenomenon the government blames on the upstart hedgehog party. The Hedgehog Party are labeled terrorists, and a bounty is put on both their membership and all the hedgehogs in the Chinese countryside, which totally exist. Over time, hedgehog hunting becomes the dominant trade of Northern China. Hedgehog pelts are the main driver of a vibrant artistic culture, used as both materials for fashion designers and raw canvas for a bold new generation of painters. One day, a young hedgehog hunter named Arnold Wei awakens. He's the son of a hedghehog hunter, who is the son of another hedgehog hunter. While skewering the morning's catch, he finds a stray artifact. A perfectly preserved shoe. He doesn't know what kind of person it belonged too, but it must have some value. He takes it to the appraiser, where he learned it once belonged to an ancient tribe called 'Dance Breakers.' No one knows what became of the Dance Breakers, but many blame them for the Great Sundering. The appraiser returns the shoe to Arnold, and tells him he should destroy it if he is wise. Arnold agrees in person, but hides the shoe underneath his bed. Something about it calls to him. Maybe the force that unmade the world, can remake it anew. Anyway, he starts learning some sick flips."

        unspeakableHorror "I liked the part where you destroyed everything I ever loved."

        arven "Thanks, the trick is remembering to keep your legs spread."

        unspeakableHorror "Really? Because mine are pretty wide but I can never get around more than twice."

        arven "You're probably not kicking your main leg hard enough, you really want to focus on that initial sweep."

        unspeakableHorror "What about hand placement?"

        arven "It's tricky. You don't want to be too slow, but you want to give it enough time for your legs to get the proper lift. For that the only real solution is practice, it comes with time."

        unspeakableHorror "That's great advice! I wish my friends were still alive for me to tell them. Are halos similar?"
